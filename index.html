				<h2> Major Discrepancies </h2>
				<h3> How College Grad's First Field of Choice Varies Aross America </h3>
			
				<p> As COVID-19 disrupts lives and destroys lesson plans for students and teachers alike,
				reminiscing on earlier days is as nostalgic as it is an escape nowadays. As thousands
				of students return home under uncomfortable circumstances, let's take a trip down memory lane
				to a less chaotic time: 2016. Yikes!
				</p>
				
				<p>Displayed below are American college student's first field they chose to major in enumerated by county,
				spanning from 2012-2017 (5-Year American Community Survey Estimate), and a bar graph ranking the data by specific major percentage
				compared to the whole e.g., (education majors/total majors in the county). You can select which major you want to view from the drop down menu. Panning and zooming are also available. There are many interesting spatial patterns,
				such as the West and East Coast's obsession with science and engineering.</p>
				
				<p> Some additional context and data: </p>
				
				<p> 33.4% of Americans (over 10 million people) reportedly have attained a Bachelor's Degree or higher circa 2017. That's an increase of 6.4% over the previous decade (Census Bureau).
				The average US student graduates with over $28,000 in debt (Institute for College Access & Success).			
				The most popular major in America is Business, at 19%. Health professions are second at 11% (CNBC). </p>
				
				<p> Enjoy, and happy viewing! </p>
